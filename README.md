# intro
I'll be creating a sudoku board complete with a 9x9 grid, 11 input buttons, a timer, and hopefully a difficulty setting that randomly populate the board accordingly.

# logic
For the game's logic, I'll create an inhibit input function that'll check if the same value is being injected in the same row, column and 3x3 section of the board. A notification should be displayed you're prohibited from playing in that square. The winning condition will be if the player can completely fill in the board. Upon winning, the board should lock and the timer halted following an option to play again.

# User story
Beneath the board will be at least 10 input buttons, nine of them representing values 1-9, the tenth button acting as the erase input, eleventh acting as the reset option. The player should be able to place whatever values they want on the board via clicking on the 9x9 grid.
